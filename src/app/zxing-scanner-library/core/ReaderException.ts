// Notes from Richard:  NOT BEING USED
// This is part of the original ZXing libary open source code, which
// I migrated to the Manifest Manager solution.  This is not being used
// to support the scanning capability of this solution.  However, I am 
// keeping it around in case it is needed in the future.  It is commented
// out, so that we won't have to maintain the code.

//import Exception from './Exception';

///**
// * Custom Error class of type Exception.

//export default class ReaderException extends Exception {}
